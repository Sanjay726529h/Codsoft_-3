**Customer Churn Prediction**
**Description**
This project focuses on predicting customer churn, which is the process where customers stop using a service or product. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers. In this project, we employ machine learning techniques to predict whether customers are likely to churn.

**Key Steps**
**Data Preprocessing:**

The project starts with data preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric features.
Data Exploration:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset better. Visualization techniques may be used to identify patterns and insights.
Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering may involve creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Selection:

We use a RandomForestClassifier as the predictive model in this project. The model is trained on historical data to learn patterns associated with customer churn.
Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC score, and a confusion matrix.
